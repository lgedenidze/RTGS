  "purposeAndContext": "Luka is modernizing a legacy Georgian RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) payment system built on Oracle 10g, transitioning from outdated hardcoded XML generation to a robust ISO 20022 messaging framework. The system processes payments exclusively through the RTGS rail, integrating with the Georgian National Bank's Montran ATS platform. The primary objective is replacing error-prone string concatenation methods with a unified architecture that supports multiple ISO 20022 message versions simultaneously (e.g., pacs.008.001.02 legacy, pacs.008.001.08 for RTGS) while maintaining compatibility with existing RKC_SEND_H and RKC_SEND_E tables.",
  "currentState": "Luka is actively replacing the legacy RTGS.GENERATE_XML procedure with a modern, registry-driven builder framework. The focus is on outbound RTGS message generation using proper XML DOM construction instead of string concatenation. Recent work includes development of comprehensive PL/SQL packages like ISO20022_UTILS, ISO20022_APPHDR_BUILDER, ISO20022_DOC_BUILDER, and ISO20022_PARSER to handle the full message lifecycle. The main constraints are Oracle 10g limitations (e.g., MD5 instead of HASH_SH256), and the need to preserve current unchangeable database structures. The system must support both legacy SWIFT MT message formats and their ISO 20022 RTGS equivalents while ensuring validation logic is message-type-aware.",
  "keyLearnings": "A unified architecture for RTGS processing using profile-based configuration is more effective than hardcoded logic. DOM-based XML generation significantly improves reliability. Supporting multiple ISO 20022 versions requires DB-driven configuration, and proper UTF-8 handling ensures Georgian character support. A three-layer validation system (schema, profile, message-type) is essential. Mapping MT to ISO 20022 requires preserving bulk processing logic, especially for message types like pacs.008.001.08 which allow multi-transaction Group Headers.",
  "approachAndPatterns": "Luka employs a profile-driven design where RTGS is treated as a unique profile with rules defined in DB config. Builders are separated into Application Header and Document generators, following registry-based version management. Implementation is phased with full documentation, inbound and outbound logic coverage, and strict validation. MT-to-ISO mappings are guided by message flow diagrams and table mappings.",
  "toolsAndResources": "Built entirely on Oracle 10g with PL/SQL packages. Relies on XML DOM methods, DBMS_OBFUSCATION_TOOLKIT (for MD5), and official ISO 20022 XSD schemas. The system is integrated with Montran ATS for Georgian RTGS processing."
